"""
Negotiation Engine Module

This module implements the core negotiation logic using GPT-powered agents.
It manages the state machine for the negotiation process and uses LangChain/AutoGen
to generate dynamic counter-offers and acceptance logic. Key responsibilities:
- Orchestrating buyer-seller interactions
- Managing negotiation state transitions
- Applying negotiation strategies
- Generating context-aware responses
